# CritterVision 🐾👀

CritterVision is a fun Android application that lets you experience the world through the eyes of different animals! Using your device's camera, the app applies real-time visual filters to simulate how animals like dogs, cats, and birds perceive their surroundings.

## 🌟 Features

* **Live Camera Feed:** See the world around you directly through the app.
* **🐶 Dog Vision Mode:** Experience a simulated dichromatic vision, primarily seeing shades of blue, yellow, and gray.
* **🐱 Cat Vision Mode:** View the world with simulated dichromatic vision similar to a dog, but with potential enhancements for blue/green distinction and slightly improved brightness in lower light.
* **🐦 Bird Vision Mode:** Get a glimpse into a bird's vibrant world with an attempt to simulate their broader color spectrum, including a suggestion of UV perception through enhanced color vibrancy.
* **👤 Original Vision Mode:** Easily switch back to the standard, unfiltered camera view.
* **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use buttons to switch between different animal perspectives.

## 📱 How to Use

1.  Launch the CritterVision app.
2.  Grant camera permission if prompted.
3.  The app will open with the live camera feed.
4.  Tap one of the animal buttons at the bottom (or side) of the screen:
    * **"Dog Vision"**
    * **"Cat Vision"**
    * **"Bird Vision"**
5.  The camera feed will update with the selected animal's simulated vision filter.
6.  Tap **"Original Vision"** (or a similar button) to return to the normal camera view.

## 🔬 Vision Filter Details (Simplified Simulations)

The vision filters are artistic interpretations based on scientific understanding of animal vision:

* **Dog Vision:**
    * **Color:** Simulates dichromatic vision (two primary color receptors). Reds and greens may appear as shades of yellow or gray. Blues and yellows are more prominent.
    * **Acuity:** May include a slight reduction in overall sharpness.
* **Cat Vision:**
    * **Color:** Also dichromatic, similar to dogs, but potentially better at distinguishing blues and greens. Reds may appear greenish.
    * **Low Light:** Slightly increased brightness/contrast to mimic better vision in dim conditions.
    * **Blur:** Distant objects might appear subtly less sharp.
* **Bird Vision (General Songbird/Pigeon):**
    * **Color:** Attempts to simulate tetrachromatic vision (four color receptors), which includes UV light. This is approximated by enhancing overall color vibrancy and potentially shifting some hues to suggest sensitivity to a broader spectrum. Blues and violets may appear more intense.
    * **Sharpness:** Generally maintains or slightly enhances image sharpness.
